# BaCon

R code for the Bayesian Connectomics (BaCon) model class, 
developed in "Predicting Phenotypes from Brain Connection Structure"
by Subha Guha, Rex Jung, and David Dunson (2019)

Run "main.R" to 
  (a) Simulate a datset having the same structure as the motivating connectome dataset, MRN-114
  (b) Analyzes the data using the BaCon methodology 
  
Before running "main.R" n.burn, n.postburn, num.reps, p, n, true.tau.v= c(.875,.925,.975)
